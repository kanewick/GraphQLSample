# GraphQLSample
This GraphQL sample is a class from within a personal project of mine. This CaseType Class gives you a little visual of the exposure I have with GraphQL working with
fields, types and mutaitons.

Exposed within the class is the GraphQL DataLoader which is used for batching and caching back end calls within the data layer, thus boosting the perfomance of GraphQL calls which is idealistically the whole purpose of using GraphQL in the first place.
